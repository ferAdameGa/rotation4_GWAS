# Association Tests with a Linear Model

```
The basic usages for linear model association analysis with either the PLINK binary ped format or
the BIMBAM format are:

./gemma -bfile [prefix] -lm [num] -o [prefix]

./gemma -g [filename] -p [filename] -a [filename] -lm [num] -o [prefix]

where the “-lm [num]” option specifies which frequentist test to use, i.e. “-lm 1” performs Wald
test, “-lm 2” performs likelihood ratio test, “-lm 3” performs score test, and “-lm 4” performs
all the three tests

“-bfile [prefix]” specifies PLINK binary ped file prefix
“-g [filename]” specifies BIMBAM mean genotype file name
“-p [filename]” specifies BIMBAM phenotype file name; 
"-a [filename]” (optional) specifies BIMBAM SNP annotation file name;
“-o [prefix]” specifies output
file prefix.
Notice that different from a linear mixed model, this analysis does not require a relatedness
matrix.
