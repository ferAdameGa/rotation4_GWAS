# Add phenoype to Plink files

```
--pheno causes phenotype values to be read from the 3rd column of the specified space- or tab-delimited file, instead of the .fam or .ped file. The first and second columns of that file must contain family and within-family IDs, respectively.

In combination with --pheno, --mpheno lets you use the (n+2)th column instead of the 3rd column, while --pheno-name lets you select a column by title. (In order to use --pheno-name, there must be a header row with first two entries 'FID' and 'IID'.) The new --pheno-merge flag tells PLINK to use the phenotype value in the .fam/.ped file when no value is present in the --pheno file; without it, the phenotype is always treated as missing in this case.
