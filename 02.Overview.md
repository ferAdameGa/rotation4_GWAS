GEMMA requires four main input files:

## 1.genotypes, 
## 2.phenotypes, 
## 3.relatedness matrix 
## 4.(optionally) covariates

Genotype and phenotype files can be in two formats, either both in the
PLINK binary ped format or both in the BIMBAM format.

I will use PLINK format


# 1. Genotypes

Is the phenotype necessary for this file??? 

> Yes.

[Add Phenotype](03.InputGenoPheno.md)

```
plink
--pheno 
```

# 2. Phenotypes (in fam file!)
This file contains phenotype information. Each line is a number indicating the phenotype value for
each individual in turn, in the same order as in the mean genotype file.

1.2 -0.3 -1.5
NA 1.5 0.3
2.7 1.1 NA
-0.2 -0.7 0.8
3.3 2.4 2.1

# 3. Relatedness Matrix File Format
   
The relatedness matrix can be supplied in two different ways:
either use the original relatedness matrix, or use the eigen values and eigen vectors of the original
relatedness matrix.

A) Original Matrix format
nxn order *.fam individual

0.3345 -0.0227 0.0103
-0.0227 0.3032 -0.0253
0.0103 -0.0253 0.353


B) The second relatedness matrix format is a three column “id id value” format, where the first two
columns show two individual id numbers, and the third column shows the relatedness value between
these two individuals. Individual ids are not required to be in the same order as in the *.fam file,
and relatedness values not listed in the relatedness matrix file will be considered as 0

id1 id1 0.3345
id1 id2 -0.0227
id1 id3 0.0103
id2 id2 0.3032
id2 id3 -0.0253
id3 id3 0.3531
